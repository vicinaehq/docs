# Script Installation

Vicinae can be installed using an automated installation script that provides a hassle-free setup experience with minimal configuration required.

<Note>
If Vicinae is already packaged by your distribution, you should install it through your package manager instead for better system integration and automatic updates.

## Quick Install

Run the following command to install Vicinae:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash
```

The installation script will automatically:

- Download the latest AppImage from GitHub releases
- Extract and install to `~/.local/vicinae`
- Create symbolic links for binaries in your PATH
- Install desktop files, icons, and default themes
- Set up `vicinae-node` for TypeScript extension support

<Note>
This installation method does **not** require root privileges. All files are installed in user directories (`~/.local/`).
</Note>

<Note>
If the script instructs you to configure your PATH, make sure to do so before proceeding.
</Note>

After installation completes, verify it was successful:

```bash
vicinae version
```

## What Gets Installed

### Extension Runtime

The script includes a standalone Node.js binary (`vicinae-node`) specifically for running third-party TypeScript extensions. This ensures extensions work even if Node.js is not installed system-wide.

<Note>
No third-party extensions are installed by default. You'll need to install them separately if desired.
</Note>

## Installation Locations

All files are installed under `~/.local/`:

```
~/.local/vicinae/          # Main installation directory
~/.local/bin/              # Symbolic links to binaries
~/.local/share/            # Desktop files, icons, and themes
```

## Update

To update Vicinae, run the installation script again. It will detect your existing installation and update it.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall Vicinae, run the installation script with the `--uninstall` argument:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vicinae.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```
