# Create your first extension

This page explains how to create your first extension.

## Requirements

In order to develop extensions, you will need:

- A working installation of NodeJS (>=20 recommended). If you are on Linux your package manager may have handled that for you already.
- A npm compatible package manager such as `npm` or `pnpm`. We always use `npm` in our examples.
- Basic knowledge of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/). No need to be an expert in order to build simple /extensions.

## Create Your Extension

The most straightforward way to create an extension is to use the [Create Extension](vicinae:///extensions/vicinae/extensionseloper/create) command from within Vicinae:

![](/extensions/create-extension.webp)

Fill in all the fields, then press `Shift + Enter` to create the extension:

![](/extensions/create-extension-success.webp)

As instructed, move to your newly created extension directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once that is done, start your extension in development mode (Vicinae needs to be running):

```bash
npm run dev
```

If all is going well, the command should output something like this:

![](/extensions/extension-dev-logs.webp)

Your extension should now come up when searching for it in the root search:

![](/extensions/first-extension-root.webp)

And then simply open it for the first time:

![](/extensions/first-extension-running.webp)

<Note>
Notice the `(Dev)` suffix in the navigation title. This means you are currently running the command as part of a development session.
In this mode, the development version of React will be used and the command will output its logs inside the console from where you started the session.
<br /> In development mode, the extension is also updated every time you make a change to any file.
