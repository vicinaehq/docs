# How to Contribute to the Documentation
Contributing to our documentation is a great way to help the community and improve the project for everyone.

## Writing Documentation with MDX
We use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for our documentation files. MDX allows you to write Markdown with embedded JSX components, while still being easy to write using [standard Markdown syntax.](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

<Note>
If you are contributing simple documentation or configuration you usually do not need to use any components. **Nearly all contributions can be made using plain Markdown!**
</Note>

## Naming and Placement Conventions
To keep our documentation organized and easy to navigate, the docs are separated into folders containing either sub-folders (in case there are multiple docs of that type as with the `src/app/extensions` folder) or a `page.mdx` in which the documentation is written.

## Adding a new File to the Navigation
To make your new documentation discoverable, add it to the navigation menu:

1. Open `src/components/Navigation.tsx`.
2. Locate the navigation structure it looks something like This

```tsx
{
  title: 'Contributing', // Title of the Category in which the files will appear
  links: [
    { title: 'Clipboard Server', href: '/contrib/clipboard' },
    { title: 'My super helpful Documentation', href: '/path/to/file.mdx'}
  ],
},
```

3. Add a new entry for your doc (relative to the `/docs` directory).
