# Launcher Window

This page documents how to customize the Vicinae launcher window. If you are looking for ways to programmatically control the window, consider using [deeplinks](/deeplinks#window-controls). {{ className: 'lead' }}


## Window sizing

For now it is not possible to change window dimensions. If you really need this, feel free to create a <a href={FEATURE_REQUEST_URL}>feature request</a>.

## Hyprland blur

All you need are the following layer rules in your Hyprland config:

```bash
layerrule = blur,vicinae
layerrule = ignorealpha 0, vicinae
```

You also need to make sure the window opacity is less than `1.0` in the Vicinae settings. It should default to a slightly transparent value.

## Window scaling

It is possible to enable window scaling for Vicinae by setting the `QT_SCALE_FACTOR` environment variable to an appropriate value:

```bash
QT_SCALE_FACTOR=1.5 vicinae server
```

<Note>
It is not recommended to set this value globally as it will force scaling for every QT app. If you need desktop-wide scaling you probably want your Wayland compositor to handle this for you. Only use this if you only need the Vicinae window to scale up or down.
</Note>

## Wayland Layer Shell

The [layer shell wayland protocol](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols/-/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml) is used to position the window and grant it exclusive keyboard focus as long as it is shown. The default behavior is to use it to position the launcher window if the running compositor supports it.

<Note>
Note that the settings window is always set to be a regular floating window: it doesn't use layer shell under any circumstance.
</Note>

### Disable layer shell 

If layer shell usage is not desired, it can be turned off at runtime by passing the `USE_LAYER_SHELL=0` environment variable to the vicinae process, like so:

```bash
USE_LAYER_SHELL=0 vicinae server
```

<Note>
Layer shell support can also be disabled at compile time, although that option is only available to users compiling from source. Using the runtime environment variable is the preferred way
to opt out of layer shell, as most binary releases will be compiled with support for it.
</Note>


## Font size

It is possible to change the base font size from within the <a href={VICINAE_GENERAL_SETTINGS_URL}>settings</a>.

## Gnome Integration

Since Gnome doesn't natively support the layer shell protocol, the launcher window is always a regular floating window. To make it behave like a layer shell window which closes on focus loss, you can use the companion [Vicinae Gnome Extension](https://github.com/dagimg-dot/vicinae-gnome-extension).
