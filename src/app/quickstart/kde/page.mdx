# KDE Quickstart

<Warning>
Since the upgrade to QT 6.10 KDE users seem to be experiencing an issue where [Vicinae crashes
directly on launch](https://github.com/vicinaehq/vicinae/issues/576). It is for now unclear what really causes this. As a temporary fix, it is recommended to use the AppImage version of vicinae (we recommend using the installation script method) which bundles its own version of QT.
</Warning>

This guide explains how to quickly get started with Vicinae on KDE Plasma.

## Start the Vicinae server

### Systemd

On KDE, the best way to launch the Vicinae server is to enable the systemd user service:

```bash
systemctl --user enable vicinae --now
```

This will start the Vicinae server immediately and make sure it is started when a new KDE session is started.

To view the server logs:

```bash
journalctl --user -u vicinae
```

### KDE Autostart

An alternative to the systemd service is to use the KDE autostart feature from the settings. Just select the Vicinae application and KDE should start the server automatically when a new session opens.

## Create keyboard shortcuts

### Toggle the window

To create a shortcut that toggles the Vicinae window on a specific keystroke, head to the KDE keyboard settings and add a custom shortcut for the Vicinae application:

Once configured, you'll be able to toggle the Vicinae window whenever the shortcut is pressed, provided that the Vicinae server is running.

### Open a specific command

You can use [deeplinks](/deeplinks) to create a shortcut that directly opens a custom Vicinae command.

Just create a new shortcut that binds to e.g. `vicinae vicinae://extensions/vicinae/clipboard/history`.
