# Niri Quickstart

This guide shows the best way to quickly get started with Vicinae on [niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri).

## Main configuration

Add the following to your niri configuration, and you are good to go.

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl
spawn-at-startup "vicinae" "server"

# use whatever shortcut floats your boat
Mod+Space repeat=false { spawn "vicinae" "toggle"; }
```

<Note>
  On first startup, Vicinae will use a lot of CPU in order to populate the file
  index.
</Note>

## Bind to a custom command

You can easily create a binding to open any vicinae command directly:

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl

Mod+P repeat=false { spawn "vicinae" "vicinae://extensions/vicinae/clipboard/history"; }
```

You can do a lot with this: [learn more about deeplinks](/deeplinks).

## Blur

Blur is currently a work in progress 

## Focus window on activation

Common vicinae workflows such as opening a shortcut will spawn a command that may result in opening a new window or tab in an existing application (typically, browsers). vicinae doesn't yet pass a proper [xdg activation token](https://wayland.app/protocols/xdg-activation-v1#xdg_activation_token_v1) to apps it launches, so the compositor may not allow them to steal focus.

A straightforward fix is to enable the following option in your niri config:

```ini
# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl

debug {
	honor-xdg-activation-with-invalid-serial
}
```
